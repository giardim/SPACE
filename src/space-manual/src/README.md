# SPACE Data Structure Visualizer

This project will help students in the Data Structures and Algorithms class at SUNY Poly.
SPACE is a project that visualizes data structures and algorithms. The 
project has two parts:

1. A C++ header file that the user must #include in their program
2. A browser app that does visualizations by reading a data file produced 
by the C++ header

### Installation 

1. Go to [https://github.com/giardim/SPACE](https://github.com/giardim/SPACE)
2. Click the green button labeled "Code"
3. Click download zip 
4. Right click the zip file in your downloads folder
5. Extract it

### Usage

1. Copy the space.hpp file into your project directory (do not move or 
delete any other files in the extracted folder). This should mean that the 
space.hpp file and your program file are in the same directory
2. Open the index.html file with a web browser
3. Click the manual button on the browser app to view detailed instructions 
on using SPACE
