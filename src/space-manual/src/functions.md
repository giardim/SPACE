# Functions

SPACE.hpp contains two main functions. The space::sout() function is used 
by the student in their programs to output their data structures into a 
data.json file. The space::save() function is used by the SPACE.hpp 
program to take the output of space::sout(), convert it to JSON, and output 
it into a data.json file. The student never uses space::save() in their 
program.
